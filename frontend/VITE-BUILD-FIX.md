# ðŸš€ CodeArena Vercel Deployment - Vite Build Fix

## Problem Solved
Fixed the "sh: line 1: vite: command not found" error during Vercel deployment.

## Root Cause
The error occurs when Vercel can't locate the `vite` command in its build environment, even though Vite is installed as a dependency.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `vercel.json` Configuration
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "buildCommand": "npx vite build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- âœ… Removed `framework: "vite"` to avoid conflicts with Vercel's automatic framework detection
- âœ… Changed build command to `npx vite build` (instead of `vite build`)
- âœ… Used `npx` which ensures the command finds the locally installed Vite binary

### 2. Ensured Vite is in Dependencies
Confirmed that Vite is properly listed in `package.json` dependencies (not devDependencies):
```json
"dependencies": {
  "vite": "^5.4.19",
  "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.5.1",
  // ... other deps
}
```

### 3. Simplified Build Scripts
Updated `package.json` scripts for clarity:
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "vite build",
  "vercel-build": "vite build"
}
```

## Why This Works

1. **`npx vite build`**: Uses npx to execute the locally installed Vite binary from `node_modules/.bin/`
2. **No framework declaration**: Prevents Vercel from applying its own Vite handling which might conflict
3. **Proper dependency placement**: Vite in `dependencies` ensures it's available during build

## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Deploy
```bash
# 1. Deploy to Vercel
cd frontend
vercel --prod

# 2. Follow the prompts to configure your project
```

### Manual Verification
1. âœ… Vite is in `dependencies` 
2. âœ… Build command uses `npx vite build`
3. âœ… Local build works: `npm run build`
4. âœ… Direct command works: `npx vite build`

## Expected Build Output
```
âœ“ 213 modules transformed.
âœ“ built in ~20s
dist/index.html  0.51 kB
dist/assets/index-[hash].css  33.09 kB
dist/assets/index-[hash].js   939.67 kB
```

## If You Still Get Errors

### Alternative Build Commands to Try:
1. `./node_modules/.bin/vite build`
2. `npm run build`
3. `yarn build` (if using Yarn)

### Check Dependencies:
```bash
npm ls vite
npm ls @vitejs/plugin-react
```

### Environment Variables:
Ensure `NODE_ENV=production` is set in Vercel dashboard.

## Success! ðŸŽ‰
Your CodeArena frontend should now deploy successfully to Vercel without the "vite: command not found" error.
